Documentation for the TodoMVC project by Sonny Aasen and Morgan Berglund
	

	Our project is built using standard HTML, CSS, JavaScript. 
	No frameworks were used during the development.
	

	We use one file for each language as it is a small application.
	

	We used a function heavy design in the JavaScript
	where we separate heavily repeated tasks into functions we can call.
	

	For the CSS we used a Desktop-first approach with different media queries,
	one query is used for bigger screens and two regulate the smaller screen designs.
	

	Our application differs from the TodoMVC only visually, we used simple css
	tricks to style most of the elements. One button to toggle-all checkboxes has
	an image source contained within the app folder.
