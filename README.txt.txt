Documentation for the TodoMVC project by Sonny Aasen and Morgan Berglund

Our project is built using standard HTML, CSS, Javascript. 
No frameworks were used during the developement.

We use one file for each language as it is a fairly small application.

We used a function heavy design in the javascript
where we separate heavily repeated tasks into functions we can call.



For the CSS we used a Desktop-first approach with different media queries,
one query is used for bigger screens and two regulate the smaller screen designs.
